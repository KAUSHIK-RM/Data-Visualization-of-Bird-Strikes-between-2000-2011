Title: Visualizing Bird Strikes: A Decade of Aviation Hazard Analysis (2000-2011)

Introduction:
Bird strikes pose a significant safety risk to aviation, with the potential to cause damage to aircraft and endanger passengers and crew. Understanding the frequency, locations, and patterns of bird strikes is crucial for implementing effective mitigation strategies. This project aims to analyze and visualize bird strike data from the period between 2000 and 2011 to gain insights into this important aviation hazard.

Objectives:

To visualize the temporal trends in bird strikes over the decade.
To identify the airports and regions most affected by bird strikes.
To explore the types of birds involved in these incidents.
To assess the severity of damage caused by bird strikes.
Data Sources:

Bird strike incident reports from aviation safety databases, government agencies, and research institutions.
Data should include information such as date, time, location (airport), aircraft type, bird species, and severity of damage.
Methodology:


Data Collection: Gather bird strike data spanning the years 2000 to 2011 from reliable sources.
Data Cleaning: Clean and preprocess the data to address inconsistencies, errors, and missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct exploratory analysis to understand the characteristics and patterns of bird strikes.
Visualization Design:
Time Series Plot: Visualize the trend in bird strikes over the decade.
Geographic Map: Map the geographic distribution of bird strikes, highlighting hotspot areas.
Bar Charts and Pie Charts: Illustrate the distribution of bird strikes by airport, bird species, and severity of damage.
Implementation: Use data visualization tools and libraries to create interactive and informative visualizations.
Interpretation: Provide insights and interpretations based on the visualizations, discussing trends, patterns, and implications for aviation safety.
Expected Deliverables:


Interactive data visualizations showcasing the temporal and spatial patterns of bird strikes.
Written report summarizing the findings, insights, and recommendations for mitigating bird strike risks.
Timeline:


Data Collection and Cleaning: 1 week
Exploratory Data Analysis: 2 weeks
Visualization Design and Implementation: 3 weeks
Interpretation and Reporting: 1 week


Conclusion:
By visualizing and analyzing bird strike data from 2000 to 2011, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the nature and extent of this aviation hazard. The findings will inform decision-makers and stakeholders in the aviation industry about strategies to minimize the risk of bird strikes and enhance aviation safety.
